# Cloud Computing

## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.

## Serverful Models
### Software as a Service (SaaS)
 - Cloud provider gives access to applications on a subscription basis
### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
 - Cloud provider gives access to servers with operating systems and tools
### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
 - Cloud providergives access to bare servers
## Why should you use cloud computing and its benefits

### Flexibility
  1. Scalability: Cloud infrastructure scales on demand to support fluctuating workloads.
  2. Storage options: Users can choose public, private, or hybrid storage offerings, depending on security needs and other considerations.
  3. Control choices: Organizations can determine their level of control with as-a-service options. These include software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
  4. Tool selection: Users can select from a menu of prebuilt tools and features to build a solution that fits their specific needs.
  5. Security features: Virtual private cloud, encryption, and API keys help keep data secure.

### Efficiency

 1. Accessibility: Cloud-based applications and data are accessible from virtually any internet-connected device.
 2. Speed to market: Developing in the cloud enables users to get their applications to market quickly.
 3. Data security: Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups.
 4. Savings on equipment: Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations the cost of servers and other equipment.
 5. Pay structure: A “utility” pay structure means users only pay for the resources they use.

### Strategic value
 1. Streamlined work: Cloud service providers (CSPs) manage underlying infrastructure, enabling organizations to focus on application development and other priorities.
 2. Regular updates: Service providers regularly update offerings to give users the most up-to-date technology.
 Collaboration: Worldwide access means teams can collaborate from widespread locations.
 1. Competitive edge: Organizations can move more nimbly than competitors who must devote IT resources to managing infrastructure.


## Who is AWS?
Amazon Web Services provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms.

Some companies who use AWS:
 - Adobe
 - Docker
 - Netflix
 - Ubisoft
 - UCAS
 - Spotify
 - Sony

## Cap-ex vs Op-ex

 - Capital expenditures (CapEx) are major purchases a company makes that are designed to be used over the long term. 
   - buildings 
   - equipment 
   - machinery
   - vehicles
 - Operating expenses (OpEx) are the day-to-day expenses a company incurs to keep its business operational.
   - utilities
   - property taxes
   - cost of goods sold (COGS)
